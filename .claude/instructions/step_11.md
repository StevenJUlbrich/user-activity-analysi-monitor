# **Step 11: Documentation & Polish**

## **Objective**

* Make the project self-explanatory and developer/onboarding friendly.
* Provide robust documentation for setup, usage, troubleshooting, and architecture.
* Refine the UI/UX for a professional, error-resilient experience.

---

## **A. Documentation Essentials**

### **1. README.md**

**Contents:**

* **Project Overview:** Purpose and scope of the Oracle User Activity Monitor.
* **Features:** What the app does, key user workflows.
* **Getting Started:**

  * Prerequisites (Python version, Poetry, Oracle client, Kerberos, dependencies)
  * Setup instructions (clone, install, configure)
  * How to run the app
* **Basic Usage:**

  * How to configure and run your first analysis
  * Screenshots or wireframes for visual reference
* **Troubleshooting:**

  * Common errors, solutions, and “what to check” for connection, kinit, reporting
* **Contribution Guidelines:** (optional, for team projects)
* **License:** Open source or internal/corporate

---

### **2. `docs/architecture.md`**

* **Directory Layout:** Annotated folder structure
* **MVC Pattern:** Explanation of how Model, View, Controller, and Integrations interact
* **Workflow Diagrams:**

  * Sequence diagram or flowchart (using Markdown/ASCII, Mermaid, or an included image)
  * “Brick-by-brick” development summary
* **Key Components:** Short description of each module/class and its responsibility
* **Config Schema Reference:** Example YAML/JSON snippets

---

### **3. `docs/user_guide.md`**

* **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

  * Setting up the Oracle/Kerberos environment
  * Filling in and saving configuration
  * Running analysis, generating reports, and emailing or logging results
* **Copy-paste Guides:**

  * How to attach/export files, paste to OneNote, etc.
* **Screenshots:** If possible, walk through all panels and workflows visually.

---

## **B. UI/UX Polish**

* **Refine Labels/Buttons:**

  * Use clear, descriptive button texts and status messages.
* **Tooltips/Help:**

  * Add tooltips to all fields/buttons that might confuse new users.
  * Use placeholder text and input validation warnings.
* **Accessibility:**

  * Check tab order, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
* **Final Styling:**

  * Consistent padding, alignment, and colors for a professional look.

---

## **C. Final Testing**

* **User Walkthrough:**

  * Start from a clean clone, follow README step by step—update docs with any missing info.
* **Edge Cases:**

  * Try invalid configs, expired Kerberos, missing files, etc., and verify error messages/help.

---

## **D. Code Polish**

* **Docstrings:** Ensure all public classes/methods are documented.
* **Remove dead code and TODOs:** Clean up any scaffolding or unused features.
* **Type Hints:** Confirm all function signatures use type hints for future maintainability.
* **Logging:** Optionally, ensure logs can be saved to file as well as shown in the UI.
* **Versioning:** Tag a release or stable commit (`v1.0.0`).

---

## **E. Next Steps/Hand-off Plan (Optional)**

* **Contribution/Dev Guide:**

  * “How to add a new query/report panel”
  * “How to test integrations or update dependencies”
* **Ideas for Future Enhancements:**

  * Automated OneNote API integration (if ever permitted)
  * Multi-user/multi-database support
  * Custom report templates
